# WeaponCharger
An addon that auto charges weapons in Elder Scrolls Online.  It uses the in game soul gem setting for charging weapons.  If you have the setting to default to crown gems it will use those first before the regualr gold gems and vice versa.

This addon will use the soul gem setting you have selected under gameplay settings to charge your weapons.

This addon is meant to be minimal.  If you want something simple that auto charges weapons, then this is what you're looking for.
It does output what weapon was charged in the chat box, other than that it's very quiet.
