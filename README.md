# WeaponCharger

###### Compatible with Murkmire DLC

An addon that auto charges weapons in Elder Scrolls Online.  It uses the in game soul gem setting for charging weapons.

This addon is meant to be minimal.  If you want something simple that auto charges weapons, then this is what you're looking for.
It does output what weapon was charged in the chat box, other than that it's very quiet.

If you download the addon from here you can remove the README.md file and its important to change the name from WeaponCharger-master to WeaponCharger.  Otherwise it will not work when grabbed from here.
